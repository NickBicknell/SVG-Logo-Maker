# SVG-Logo-Maker

## Description

I developed the SVG logo maker to create a quick and easy way to make a logo. By using NodeJS, inquirer the application will ask the user a series of questions that generates a SVG logo based on the users input. The application also uses jest to test the code used to make the shapes. This project helped further my knowledge and confidence using NodeJS and inquirer. Using jest helped my development process to be smoother and more efficent with less trial and error which drastically improved the time it took to develop the application.

In a terminal like Git Bash, navigate to the repo containing the index.js file. Then run the comment `node index.js`. The user will be prompted with a series of questions to develop the logo.SVG file. The user will choose a logo shape, shape color, up to three letters of text that overlays the shape, and the color of the text. After answering all questions, a logo.svg file will be generated in the examples directory.
